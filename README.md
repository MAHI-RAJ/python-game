THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT !

This project is about a main menu , which asks you 4 different types of games to play and whichever game you select , it starts executing that selectetd game.
this project retrieves the data from a MYSQL database and stores the user inputted data in the TEXT FILES .

The game starts with your choice but ends with your Luck :) !
